# Title Regex Tutorial

Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a special tool used in programming and text processing. It is a compilation of elements that allows you to search, match, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. Using Regex, you can validate and verify various pieces of information like email addresses, phone numbers, and websites are correct. In this guide we will go into further detail about the basic building bloxks of regular expressions and how they work to create patterns.

## Summary

This guide will dive into the Regular Expresion that is used for matching emails. This Regex is used to validate whether or not the provided text represents a valid email address. It verifies that the email has the correct format such as the 'local part': the part before the @ symbol, the domain after the @ symbol, and the top domain such as .com or .org. This enforces specific rules for each part, including the characters permitted.

Here is the code snippet: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

This line of code can be used in web development to validate if text follows the pattern of an email address.
